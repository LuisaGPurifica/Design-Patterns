# Design-Patterns

## Gamma categorization
It splits the design patterns in three:
1. Creational Patterns
  *  Design patterns which deal with creating objects
  *  Explicit (constructors) vs. Implicit (Dependency Injection, Reflection, etc)
  *  Wholesale (single statement) vs. piecewise (step by step)

2. Structural Patterns


3. Behavioral Patterns
