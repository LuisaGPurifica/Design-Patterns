# Design-Patterns

## Gamma categorization
It splits the design patterns in three:
1. Creational Patterns
  *  Design patterns which deal with creating objects
  *  Explicit (constructors) vs. Implicit (Dependency Injection, Reflection, etc)
  *  Wholesale (single statement) vs. piecewise (step by step)
  *  Builder, Factory, Prototype and Singleton Patterns

2. Structural Patterns
* Concern with the structure (members of a class)
* Mimic the underlying class' interface
* Stress the importance of good API design
* Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Flyweight and Proxy Patterns

3. Behavioral Patterns
* Concern with the assignment of responsibilities between objects, or, encapsulating behavior in an object and delegating requests to it
* Concentrate on the way objects are interconnected
* Chain, Command, Iterator, Mediator, Memento, Observer, State, Template, Strategy and Visitor Patterns
